<h1>The Best Movies According to Edmund</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</h3>
<p>From go to whoa this movie kept me enthralled. A wonderful story that captures your imagination.</p>
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>The first Top Gun was good, this one is even better. Was never a big fan of Tom Cruise but this one changed my mind.</p>
<h3>The Great Escape</h3>
<p>One of the all time classics. Steve McQueen is a legend and proves his star quality in this film. Based on true events in WWII, I recommend this to everyone.</p>
